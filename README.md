# mech-interp

## 1. Write your own transformer
Run ```pip install -e .```. I have written this transformer by following and solving the ARENA exercises. To test the layers, I have used the gpt from ```HookedTransformer```.

Train the sample transformer using ```1-train_sample_transformer.ipynb```.

## 2. Introduction to Mechanistic Interpretability

- explore transformer lens
- visualize attention patterns
- write basic detectors
- understand induction heads
- direct logit attribution
- induction head ablation
